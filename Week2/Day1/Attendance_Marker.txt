Pseudo-code Problem - Attendance Marker

Start
1. Represent attendance as 2D Array [students][days].
2. Each cell: 'P' (Present) or 'A' (Absent).
3. Daily marking: update attendance for each student.
4. Teacher can update attendance if needed.
5. Generate monthly report per student: count 'P' values.
6. Example:
   - Student 1 first week: P, P, A, P, P, P, A
   - Teacher updates day 3 from A â†’ P.
   - Report: Student 1 present 26 days.
